# 100 Days Of Code - My Log!

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018!  -- A New Year's Resolution...


**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML5, CSS, And some basic design with bootstrap on FreeCodeCamp! (Didn't Finish the Bootstrap Section though).
Learned that CSS seems to be contained in <style> </style>. is this true? What's the relationship between CSS and HTML? it feels like they're almost one and the same.

**Thoughts:** None of the actual coding thus far was terribly difficult- but jeez is there a whole lot ot memorize. As in, there's a million and one ways to edit and manipulate every little thing- maybe keeping a reference sheet/site for bootstrap would be handy?

**Link to work:** I got about this far today: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-bootstrap-grid-to-put-elements-side-by-side


### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got almost all the way through the jQuery stuff today on FreeCodeCamp! did around 20+ exercises in an hour?



**Thoughts** I tried the bootstrap/jQuery stuff a while ago, but it didn't exactly make sense at the time- there was a lot of different things to remember... now that I go back over it though, I'm actually understanding what the heck is going on! I'm excited to get to the challenge where I make my own (very, very humble) website!

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery, Finished Bootstrap, Finished blah blah blah... important part is- I GOT STARTED ON MY FIRST WEBSITE! (Tribute page to ada lovelace, the mother of computing). made a well, linked my Github, put some header text, and got an image in...

**Thoughts:** There are so many ways to do every little thing! For example, Right now I'm wanting to center the Picture of Ms. Ada... So, I could just have her picture pushed X-pixels over to the right- but then it wouldn't be responsive, or look quite the same on mobile. So, I need to use bootstrap. but by using bootstrap, I have to figure out how to center things respectively using its grid system. ayee!

### Day 3: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: got some SERIOUS work done one my tribute page! so much so that its actually a finished rough-draft! I centered a pic of Ada, added a pic of her famous work, as well as rough timeline of her life and a quote about her. ...aaaand a link to here ;)

**Thoughts:** Coding this webpage was kinda challenging, and it took a LOT of reading, but it was SO rewarding!

### Day 4: January 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a really *rough* draft of a portfolio page. it has a fixed-position, collapsable navbar. also has an image or two, and some blaceholder text, as well as a decent color-scheme going for it.

**Thoughts:** Today's progress is the defenition, no, the essense, of a grind. it was slow, often flat out tedious, and sometimes downright painful. it took me hours to get the damned navbar looking right, and then I realized it wouldn't work on mobile, so I spent another few hours trying to get a collapseable version working, which wouldnt, because I forgot to include jQuery. yeeesh. Still feels good though, that I managed some progress at the end of the day...

### Day 5: January 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added some text, some page-breaks, and fixed the images breaking on mobile.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more than an hour sometimes to work on things... it feels like, at the rate I'm learning things, so little progress is being made.

### Day 6: January 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added portfolio and contact me sections, as well as placeholder pictures for the portfolio-section, and some rather rough forms for the "contact me" section that the user can fill out.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more than an hour sometimes to work on things... it feels like, at the rate I'm learning things, so little progress is being made.

### Day 7: January 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added Social-media links to my work. Additionally, I managed to get a scroll-spy working for the webpage, so now users may click at the labels at the top of the page to access any portion. 

**Thoughts:** I wish I was able to work more quickly. the progress I'm making now feels so... minimal. I mean, I've only been dedicating around an hour each to to this project, but it annoyes me so much that I can't actually make decent progress...

### Day 8: January 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Linked Social media links to actual websites, and they worked! also, I got them lined up all pretty and in the middle! additionally, I managed to add some fancy fonts to the otherwise ugly text on the webpage, and changed the webpage's color to a more appealing blue-hue.

**Thoughts:** Doing a little bit of searching and reading makes A LOT of coding easier...
