# 100 Days Of Code - My Log!

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018!  -- A New Year's Resolution...


**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML5, CSS, And some basic design with bootstrap on FreeCodeCamp! (Didn't Finish the Bootstrap Section though).
Learned that CSS seems to be contained in <style> </style>. is this true? What's the relationship between CSS and HTML? it feels like they're almost one and the same.

**Thoughts:** None of the actual coding thus far was terribly difficult- but jeez is there a whole lot ot memorize. As in, there's a million and one ways to edit and manipulate every little thing- maybe keeping a reference sheet/site for bootstrap would be handy?

**Link to work:** I got about this far today: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-bootstrap-grid-to-put-elements-side-by-side


### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got almost all the way through the jQuery stuff today on FreeCodeCamp! did around 20+ exercises in an hour?



**Thoughts** I tried the bootstrap/jQuery stuff a while ago, but it didn't exactly make sense at the time- there was a lot of different things to remember... now that I go back over it though, I'm actually understanding what the heck is going on! I'm excited to get to the challenge where I make my own (very, very humble) website!
