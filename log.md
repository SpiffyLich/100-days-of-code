# 100 Days Of Code - My Log!

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018!  -- A New Year's Resolution...


**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML5, CSS, And some basic design with bootstrap on FreeCodeCamp! (Didn't Finish the Bootstrap Section though).
Learned that CSS seems to be contained in <style> </style>. is this true? What's the relationship between CSS and HTML? it feels like they're almost one and the same.

**Thoughts:** None of the actual coding thus far was terribly difficult- but jeez is there a whole lot ot memorize. As in, there's a million and one ways to edit and manipulate every little thing- maybe keeping a reference sheet/site for bootstrap would be handy?

**Link to work:** I got about this far today: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-bootstrap-grid-to-put-elements-side-by-side


### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
